1) You'll be asked to enter your skill.
2) Program will fetch data from RGSOC projects page, and filter projects that match your skills.
3) If there are more than one projects, it will proceed according to no. applicants who have considered project as first choice/second choice.(Currently I've used applicant's 1st choice(draft), but more can be added similarily)
